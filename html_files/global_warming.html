            What is global warming? Global warming is directly related to climated change and is the increase of temperature on the surface of the Earth. Such increase in temperature may have diverse effects on ecosystems of animals in nature and may even cause the collapse of our society. This is an immediate problem and should be addressed as fast as possible to ensure that this increase in temperature wont be permanent. If it does become permanent, mass extinctions will occur and the eventual collapse of mankind will be inevitable due to our ignorance to the pressing issue.

          <p class="text">
            The main cause of global warming are the extreme release of greenhouse gases. The three greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gases are not necessarily bad for the Earth. They are vital in keeping our planet warm and suitable for life. However, too much of anything is bad, and that applies for greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases reflect the heat back to the Earth instead of letting it escape into empty space. With an overabundance of greenhouse gases, the heat will keep on reflecting back to the surface to the Earth and will continue to heat it up. This is why the temperature of the Earth rose after the industrial revolution, with machines now pumping out CO2, it creates a layer of gas that heats up the Earth. Nitrous oxide is a very potent greenhouse gas, with a potency of up to 300 times more than carbon dioxide. Unlike methane, nitrous oxide is similar to carbon dioxide where it lasts in our atmosphere for a very long time.

            There are multiple factors to global warming. These are negligence by humans to preserve nature, low efficiency in power generation, transmission, and transformation, industrial waste, forest fires, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            The turbines that generate electricity, the transformers that transform the electricity, and the wires that transport the electricity are not 100% efficient and some of the energy gets lost to heat or by other means to the environment. The process of convertying oil or natural gas into electricity is not straightforward and has a lot of inefficiency. In power generation plants that use fossil fuels, there will be lots of smoke from the furnaces that burn such fuels. Liquid fuel vehicles that use diesel or gasoline are big contributors to global warming. With the majority of people owning a car, the carbon dioxide emissions rise exponentially due to the sheer volume of vehicles. Industrial regions that have a lot of factories are also major sources of air pollution.

          <h1>What is the solution to this problem?</h1>
          <img src="../images/global_warming.html/nuclear_energy.jpg" alt="" class="content_img">
          <p class="text">
            The solution to global warming is to use renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, water, or geothermal energy. These are also not 100% efficient, however there is no downside to using such sources for energy. It is better to use what is already there rather than rely on burning fuel that is limited on Earth. Another source of energy which is not widely used due to expense and possible danger is nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is the use of unstable isotopes of uranium or plutonium to heat up water which spins a turbine that generates electricity. 
            <br>
            
            <br>
            This is very similar to burning fossil fuels but the difference is that instead of burning fuel to produce heat, we are reacting matter to produce heat through nuclear reactions. Because of multiple treaties and rules set by the international community, it is difficult to start nuclear energy projects due to the difficulty to obtain and process nuclear fuel, the complexity of nuclear reactors, and the possibility of a nation diverting used fuel into nuclear armaments. There have also been scares due to nuclear reactor meltdowns such as the one in Chernobyl. However, overall, nuclear reactors cause less deaths than facilities that use fossil fuels to generate electricity. The science is well researched, and the main causes for such errors is human incompetency.
            <br>
          
            <br>
            There are new technologies being researched such as nuclear fusion which unlike nuclear fission, does not create a radioactive meltdown when the reaction goes wrong. The most reliable out of all of these are just the wind and water turbines and solar panels which are cheap and easy to build and place. Think of this, if we put thousands of solar panel arrays in the sweltering hot and sunny Africa, think of all the energy it will be able to produce. Renewable energy sources are truly the key for a green world.
