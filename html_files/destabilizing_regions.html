            The latest conflicts in Ukraine and Russia and the rising tensions between Communist China and Democratic Taiwan are causing some worry in the world. Such as the one in eastern Europe where the Russians have declared war on the Ukrainians and are capturing and annexing territory for their own.

        Both sides have suffered massive loss of life and resources all for politics and square kilometers of land. The war was unjustified and western countries and alliances such as NATO and the EU only provide economic and logistical support, not military support in fear of getting directly involved in the conflict against Russia.
