            Third world countries such as the ones in Africa and even our own country, the Philippines, have a large population who are in poverty. Poverty is not making ends meat and struggling to live due to no income. People in poverty are commonly found on the streets begging for money to buy food and hopefully live for another day. Every human deserves the right to be fed and to have any form of housing. These people on the streets do not have good access to food and have to sleep outside and face the elements such as the summer heat, the winter cold, and any other natural disaster.
