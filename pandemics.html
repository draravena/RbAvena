        What are pandemics? Pandemics are the rapid spread of a disease across the entire world. An example of a pandemic is the COVID-19 pandemic that started during 2020. This pandemic took the entire world by surprise and showed how little preparation each country truly has to respond to such pandemics. For example, the supply chain could not perform at the same level and efficiency when the pandemic hit. This caused prices to rise due to lower supply. A notable jump in price were semiconductor electronics used in computers, factory machines, and vehicles. 
        <br>
        Most countries had very little hospital capacity or experience to handle such pandemics. An example of a country is India, multiple people were rushed to hospitals and were refused entry or care due to the shortage of oxygen tanks in the country. The supposed oxygen tank factories to be built in reponse to the sudden rise in demand for oxygen tanks were not built in time and this shortage and refusal of entry in the hospital could have been the reason why many people in India died due to COVID-19 complications.
